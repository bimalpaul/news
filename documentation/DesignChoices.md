# Design Choices ðŸŽ¨

* [CRA](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the app
* React - This is currently the UI framework I'm most comfortable with
* React Context - For easily passing state around the child/grand-child components
* Session Storage - To keep track of favorites, and viewed articles even on page refresh (React's state-context is rewritten on page reload)
* [React Memo](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactmemo) to memoize the components so they're not re-rendered due to side-effects
* [Grommet](https://v2.grommet.io/components), and [Grommet Icons](https://icons.grommet.io/) - For a light-weight design system so I don't have to do too much in terms of styling. I also wanted to try something that wasn't Material UI
