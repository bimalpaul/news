## Description

High-level goal: build a news browser leveraging [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

Detailed goals below:

1. I need to be able to view a list of the latest news articles. For each article, I want to see:
    1. title
    2. source
    3. time of publishing
    4. description
    5. image (if available)
2. On the article list view, I need to be able to filter results by entering search keywords.
3. I need to be able to maintain a separate list of favorite articles (need to be able to add and remove).
4. (bonus) I want to be able to know which articles I already read (through some visual indicator distinguishing the read articles on the list view).
5. For any article, I need to be able to visit the source page.

## Requirements

- We’re looking for code that is clean, readable, performant, and maintainable.
- You can implement the project in any framework of your choice.
- Feel free to leverage 3rd-party component libraries.
- (Not required but nice-to-have) The end user experience should be delightful.
- Before submission, please fill out the “Documentation” section below, briefly documenting how you tackled this problem, implementation tradeoffs, future enhancements, etc. Please also include detailed instructions on how to stand up the project for local testing.
- Have fun and be as creative as you like!

## Submission

After the completion of this challenge, we will schedule a follow-up discussion.
